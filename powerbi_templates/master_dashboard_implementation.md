   VAR SentimentWeight = 0.3
   VAR NormalizedHealth = [Overall_Health_Score] / 100
   VAR NormalizedValuation = IF([Current_Price] < [Average_Fair_Value], 
                              MIN(([Average_Fair_Value] - [Current_Price]) / [Current_Price], 1), 
                              0)
   VAR NormalizedSentiment = ([Overall_Sentiment] + 1) / 2
   RETURN (NormalizedHealth * HealthWeight) +
